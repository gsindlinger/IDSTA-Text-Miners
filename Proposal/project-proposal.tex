\section{Introduction}
Motivate your project and state the \textit{real-world problem} you want to solve.

\section{Section Name}

Use sections to organize your contents. Read the project proposal guidelines available on Moodle to get more information on the contents your proposal should cover. Do not forget to cite online sources~\cite{WFR2017}, books~\cite{grus2019data} or articles you are referencing! It may also be useful to integrate charts or figures in your proposal as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:example}.

In the Latex source provided together with this PDF, you also find hints on how to work on one Latex project collaboratively.

% The following is especially useful if you work together on one proposal or report, and want to alter its content independently from each other (e.g., to keep your commit history clean).

% Alternative: put content in separate files
% Check the difference between including these files using \input{filename} and \include{filename} and see which one you like better
%\chapter{Einleitung}\label{intro}
%\input{introduction}

%\chapter{Voraussetzungen}\label{bg}

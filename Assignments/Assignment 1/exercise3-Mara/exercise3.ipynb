    "1. Download the folders containing PDF files provided via Moodle (1-3-pdf-files.zip). Since the PDF format cannot be directly used to process text, you first have to convert the file contents to plain text. Find two different methods to convert PDFs to text, and compare their performance. You should provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis. For comparison of two generated files, use Pythonâ€™s SequenceMatcher.ratio(). With this analysis as a basis, choose one of the methods, and provide the processed raw text files in the submission folder. Justify your decision!\n"

    "    <li>There is a considerable discrepancy between the 'double_ocr.txt' file produced by PyPDF2 and the one produced by pdftotext, since the similarity of the two files is ca. 0.13. <br> \n",
    "    After comparing each of the files with the original pdf, we noticed that the PyPDF2 text file was produced by traversing each column in the pdf, top to bottom, left to right. So the logic of the text was preserved. <br>\n",
    "    However, the pdftotext file was generated by traversing the pdf top to bottom without respecting the columns, which is why the information from different columns was mixed.</li>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <li>'bahnstadt.txt' was another file where significant differences appeared. Once again, pdftotext traversed pages from left to right, top to bottom without preserving the logic of the original data. For example, on the page \"Inhalt\" sections, numbers and subsections were mixed. PyPDF2 on the other hand preserved this logic.<br> \n",
    "    Furthermore, PyPDF2 took care of the line break from page 4 to 5, whereas pdftotext inserted in the middle of the sentence starting on page 4 the data:<br>\n",

    "# Reasons why PDF to plain text conversion is hard\n",
    "\n",
    "A PDF file consists of a set of instructions where each of them has one of the following roles: setting the font to use by the following instructions, setting the text position and direction to use by the upcoming instructions or drawing text by given string arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon converting a pdf to plain text, the following problems might occur:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>The string drawing instructions can occur in different orders, so a converter cannot simply take the string arguments in the order they appear and concatenate them. Text positioning instructions also need to be taken into account.</li>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <li>The text in a pdf might be organized over multiple columns. Hence, the question arises how to read the data from such a file: line by line without respecting column boundaries or column by column, starting left and ending right. Furthermore, the text might be multi-columnar without the pdf containing any hints in this respect.</li>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <li>Spaces are sometimes created by text positioning instructions rather than by drawing a space glyph. A text extractor that does not take this possibility into account might return a result without spaces.</li>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <li>Usually for bold text one uses a different, bold font program; if that is not at hand, people emulate bold by printing the same text twice with a minute offset; with a slightly larger offset and a different color a shadow effect can be emulated; if the text extractor does not try to recognize this, once can end up having some duplicate characters in the output.</li>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <li>Text may be drawn using the same color as the background; to recognize this, a text extractor has to take into account anything drawn beforehand in the location of the text.</li>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <li>The OCR sometimes misses hyperlinks, more frequently when natural anchor text is used instead of the actual URL.</li>\n",

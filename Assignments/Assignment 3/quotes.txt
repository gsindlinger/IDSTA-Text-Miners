what that rachel did to her life we ran into her parents at the club they were not playing very well
 not tell you what they spent on that wedding but forty thousand dollars is lot of money
well at least she had the chance to leave man at the altar

nothing it an expression
no it not
do listen to your mother you re independent and you always have been even when you were kid and you were chubby and you had no friends you were just fine and you would read alone in your room and your puzzles
look there are people like ross who need to shoot for the stars with his museum and his papers getting published other people are satisfied with staying where they are telling you these are the people who never get cancer
and read about these women trying to have it all and thank god our little harmonica does seem to have that problem
trying desperately to change the subject so ross what going on with you any stories digs her elbow into his hand no news no little anecdotes to share with the folks
pulls his hand away okay okay to his parents look uh realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me and so well here the deal carol lesbian she living with woman named susan she pregnant with my child and she and susan are going to raise the baby

like crop circles or the bermuda triangle or evolution
whoa whoa whoa what you do uh you do believe in evolution
nah not really
you do believe in evolution
 do know it just you know monkeys darwin you know it it nice story just think it little too easy
too easy too the process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single celled organisms too easy
yeah just do buy it
uh excuse me evolution is not for you to buy phoebe evolution is scientific fact like like like the air we breathe like gravity
ok do get me started on gravity
you uh you do believe in gravity
well it not so much that you know like do believe in it you know it just do know lately get the feeling that not so much being pulled down as am being pushed

he right nobody benefit and youre just hurt her

all right look if you absolutely have to tell her at least wait until the timing right and that what deathbeds are for
yeah okay he plops down into one of the leather chairs with the footrest extended
all right okay now we just have to make sure she doesn find out some other way spins the chair around so that ross is facing him did you think about the trail
what trail
stomps on the footrest which pops ross up into sitting position the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it slapping his hands with each word you always have to think about the trail
oh don think there any trail
okay okay okay ah chloe works with that guy issac issac sister is jasmine and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe and phoebe friends with rachel and that the trail did it
reading from the instructions after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one

grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion
okay does so ow ow oh oh
was it not pain free
no it was painful oh my god they should call it pain zine now with little wax

that quite all right but feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped
looks around for the camera okay umm well first would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh for yelling at you
fair enough
now you re probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah she puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it rachel then does know where to put her hands who did who did not umm yell at you and storm out and think that big mistake and here why made huge fool of myself and came back that shows courage when thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job said no that shows integrity and was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage suddenly realizes that she said courage twice okay umm now know already said courage but know you got have courage and umm and finally when thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace said no and was not litigious by the way litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make lawsuit against so she did want to sue him do worry had to look it up too so there you go you got you got counts them off with her fingers courage you got integrity you got pause courage again and not litigious look mr

zelner right knew that really really want this job and think think would be really good at it

and it could ve just as easily have been bullet
hey joe you ever think about joining the force we could use guy like you
who jumps at loud noises
wow could ve died tonight
yeah if the car that backfired had run over you know what think go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life he gets up and starts for the door

returning oh my god storms out
to phoebe so you wanna get some dinner
yeah sure yep gets up oh know what if heard shot right now throw my body on you

no no just tired know from from the walk

you dove in front of ross ross
that what this is about oh my god you hate ross
 do not hate ross
of course you do saved him you re mad at me it all adds up you want ross out of the picture
what picture
 do know but do like what hearing
look very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire but know it could ve been bullet and you know you did try to save me
ohh you re upset because you think chose ross over you no knew you could take care of yourself know mean ross he need help he not street like us
when it comes down to it you would risk your life for ross before you would for me that the bottom line
well no not exactly all right look was trying to save ross okay my sandwich was next to ross all right was was trying to save my sandwich
from bullet
 know it does make much sense
much sense
look chandler it was instinct okay just went for it
so you risked your life for sandwich
 know it sounds crazy but chandler this is goes and picks up the sandwich the greatest sandwich in the world
so you did uh choose ross before me
no would never do that you youre like my brother

yeah in fact to prove how much you mean to me he unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for chandler here
thanks he grabs the sandwich
no eh oh oi easy it not hot dog
how good is that
with his mouthful oh oi ho yeah

hm hmm goes to take another bite
oh whoa hey dude what are you doing
 thought you were showing me how much you mean to me
yeah with bite takes back the sandwich gee eez
hey hi
rach what uh what are you doing here
hey know what you are in our apartment all the time okay this is this is just drop in the bucket mister
know it it does matter the important thing is that you re here you re my friend and you re here oh he goes over and hugs her
okay just little scared what going on ross
the most amazing thing happened tonight thought my number was up had an actual near death experience
what what what happened
okay okay we were on the ride along with gary right

and somebody took shot at me
gasps really
no car backfired but rachel suddenly calms down thought somebody was taking shot at me and rach survived and was filled with this this great respect for life know want to experience every moment want to seize every opportunity am seeing everything so so clearly now
because car backfired
stares at her briefly okay why are you here
well do know how this fits into your whole seizing thing but um emily called you today
you talked to her
no she left message he starts for the machine stopping him but it it kinda got erased there just pause something wrong with your machine
well okay what what did she say
well uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make mistake breaking up and uh she wants you to call her

now that that was good thing that told you right
huh yeah yes of course
okay thank you thank you because sorry all right because know what she did want menot important the point is was right your decision okay was right she starts for the door stops your decision
right guess guess should call emily
okay no that not the right decision that not that not right no ross ross come on mean that woman made you miserable okay ross do you really want to get back into that
okay look yesterday would ve even considered calling her back but my ex wife calls on the same day have near death experience mean that that has got to mean something
ugh ross that was not near death experience that was barely an experience
you were there okay maybe this is something that supposed to seize know
okay know what maybe this is not about seizing stuff maybe this is about escaping stuff

 mean look look today you escaped pause not believing it death know and maybe this is chance for you to escape getting back together with emily
that does make sense because do wanna seize some opportunity but really do wanna see or talk to her
well there you go
yeah maybe today is just close call day
laughing close call day
hey thanks rach they hug
ohh honey no problem okay gets up
oh wait wait wait the message is blinking maybe you did erase it

on machine hey ross it you hits the stop button oh yeah no that that an old message nobody needs to hear that
no she heads for the door again
looking at the coffee table where his money was hey umm was was monica here

yeah want my money back
going out the door yeah uh you you probably need that for stamps right
hey pheebs has gary ever been shot at for real
yes once yeah little he kinda did it to himself it not really good story
 wonder how would react under fire know and not backfire but but heavy fire like was in war or something
man would be great in war mean really think would make fantastic military leader mean know would make general way before any of you guys
before or after you were shot by your own troops
 know where joey would be he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us
yes if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches
yeah hero sandwiches points at ross who points back
well you all know that pacifist so not interested in war in any way gets up but know what when the revolution comes will have to destroy you all starts to leave to joey not you joey

who denise
my roommate
you have roommate
yes denise denise
hey what is with the secrecy phoebe huh and what about this denise is she cute

oh that umm she took it really well
you didn tell her did you

of course not because youre in love with her
 am not in love with her she was very upset about having to move out so eh didn tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset just comforted her as friend

ah ha classic sign of love the hug
it also sign of friendship
yeah not in your case lovey loverson tries to take bite out of ross cookie
grabs back his cookie it was hug
okay just tell me this did you or did you not smell her hair
 smell her hair what if did
ninety percent of women pheromones come out the top of her head that why that why women are shorter so that men will fall in love when they hug them ross is staring at her dumbfounded oh come on ross youre scientist

taking his coffee okay whatever you say but just be careful all right rachel not in the same place you are
grabbing back his coffee if the place you are referring too is being in love then she is in the same place as me because am not in that place

well like that idea obviously was thinking maybe maybe maybe it could be game room know mean you can buy old arcade games like uh like space invaders and asteroids for 200 the real ones the big big ones

okay so you mean no as in gee chandler what an interesting idea let discuss it before we reject it completely
oh sorry of course mean that interesting idea umm talk about it but no

na uh no we are all responsible for our own babies
see that where think that youre wrong weve been playing these babies man for man we should really be playing zone defense
what do you mean
 just think that things would go lot smoother if we each have our own zone phoebe you can be in charge of wiping and know mon you can be in charge of diapering and can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around he degrades into baby talk but he means when they grab his finger
that sounds really great but maybe you should be in charge of wiping
okay rookie should not be in the end zone
this is so great this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant
yeah checking the final diaper well this is not what ordered
entering hey guys


hey babies oh having the best morning that uh that porsche ve got the keys too still there

what equity investments
the ones that got me the porsche will you keep up chandler wipes his forehead with baby wipe that might have been used he drops it disgustedly but figured if if people keep seeing me just standing there theyre start to think that don own it so figured ll wash it right monica you got bucket and some soap can borrow

chandler what are you doing that thing can put someone eye out
he can do more than that he can destroy the universe
no chandler they can swallow one of those little parts and also look at his smooth area that just mess them up
theyre not swallow anything you guys are being way over protective when was kid my mom used to just throw me into pile of broken glass

glass sand whatever walks out as monica and phoebe turn to check on the babies again
oh look at little leslie stretching in her sleep
oh it so cute wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head

good what made you change your mind
 swallowed the sonic blaster gun
how did that happen
well was trying to prove that was right know and it turns out was wrong and now it lodged in my throat mimics cat trying to cough up hairball he does it again
damnit know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and and no one was watching chandler he does it again
okay you two are asking the court for an annulment
yes your honor and here are are forms all filled out
so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr geller is mentally unstable
fine mentally unstable
and based on the fact that mr geller is intravenous drug user

uh yes heroin and crack
crack isn even an intravenous drug
well you would know
now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage
oh come on
starts to cry ross please found the magazines
and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage well that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin
okay sorry this is insane not addicted to heroin not gay and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything look ll consummate this marriage right here right now
that won be necessary
and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies

now if you were two involved in serious relationship that really creates problem
ross your honor rest assured relationship ended like two years ago to the stenographer and could you strike consummated like bunnies from the record
is there anything in this record that is actually true
well yes we got married in vegas and uh and the names think
well based on what heard you two certainly don qualify for an annulment if you two don want to be together youll have to file for divorce
stands up that great are you happy now look what you did with your funny funny form
stands up as well what me what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense
and whatnotices the stenographer is still typingwhat are you typing that for did you hear what she said we don get the annulment don type that what stop typing he goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in the process pushes rachel out of his way hey stop typing he still typing stop typing stop typing
to the judge okay do you see do you see what youre keeping me married too

entering wearing nothing but porsche clothes so the porsche guy took his car back
but you found the keys to his clothes
no no just uh just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks own porsche

pause phoebe would you take look at this mess
deadpan oh honey thank god youre home was getting worried

well know this whole marriage thing kinda my idea
excuse me
well remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married

and uh yeah didn really didn want to say anything but it kinda it just it kinda kept coming back to me and umm remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat lot of grapes and uh and thought it would be funnier if we got married so as as compromise we decided first to get married and then ross joins in to eat lot of grapes so umm sorry got us into this mess
so then if if mean if you think about it this is all pause your fault
yeah don push it though
ve got to say know divorce lot of women never thought would be divorcing you
 know always thought if you and got married it would be the one that stuck and it wouldn be secret and we wouldn have our wedding dinner at pizza hut they both laugh
did did even treat
no it was on the house it was it was newlywed special
that may be the most depressing thing ve heard in my life should probably get these to my lawyer office
hey thanks ross for taking care of all of this

totally exits
hey hey be careful around my porsche
the same one from before approaches hi joey

to chandler out of words should just say the whole thing again

hey uh have you guys scene chandler
staring at him whno but know who did stop in here looking for ya tennille
so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday you don really believe that do you
sure do in fact think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural mean look at pigs let take second here and look at pigs okay pigs don mate for life mean pig can have like hundred sexual partners in lifetime and that just an ordinary pig not even pig that good at sports
yeah but that pigs not people
if marriage worked be all for it but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is 97

yeah pretty confident about that that what makes it so easy for me to be 80 happy for monica and chandler it would be nice to have little guarantee though
what do you mean
well know some people make deals with friend like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40 they marry each other
you mean backup

well hey it just backup

hey monica

well you know chandler

maybe that the problem

chandler is complex fellow one who is unlikely to take wife
is that some kind of boat talk
 don know all excited haven totally decided how to talk on my boat yet
what does he think does he think just wait around for nothing
monica face it chandler is against marriage and and always will be

you tell her jack can do it
what happened you still have the monica wedding fund don you
we have it only now we call it the beach house
 don believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house
were sorry honey but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you pay for it yourself
you bought the beach house when was 23
which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can put price on that sweetie
we really do feel bad about this though
we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell so we redid the kitchen
what about when started dating chandler
well it was chandler we didn think he ever propose
clearly did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal starts to make up for lost time and takes big swig of his drink
 can believe it that there is no money for my wedding
we might still have some money if your father didn think it was good idea to sell ice over the internet
it seemed like such simple idea
stupid jack the word is stupid
all right enough don want to hear about it anymore under his breath good luck chandler chandler takes another drink
okay now going to touch you he does so very gingerly ohh that soft he starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage him with those

and and and not only that gettin new brain
so great things are happening at work and in your personal life
wait what do you mean youre getting new brain
oh well theyre killing off one of the characters on the show and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body
what brain transplant
seriously yes it highly controversial procedure
it ridiculous
well think it ridiculous that you haven had sex in three and half months
to monica and rachel it winter they are fewer people on the street rachel and monica smile and nod knowingly
who are they killing off
uh cecilia monroe she plays jessica lockhart
she my favorite character on dool

she is so good at throwing drinks in people faces mean don think ve ever seen her finish beverage
and the way she slaps all the time

wouldn you love to do it just once raises her hand towards chandler
don do it
cecilia monroe man what great actress
oh tell me about it and she been on the show forever it be really hard to fill her shoes
yeah yeah help me out here when you come out of the brain transplant you are going to be her
yes but in drake remoray body ross laughs unbelievably why is this so hard for you to get thought you were scientist
clears throat rach so that guy there straight or gay
they both look behind them well have to say gay
yeah why
well mainly because he kissing that other guy
oh no not that guy there that guy right there pointing to an attractive man sitting at table behind them
oh yeah he too cute to be straight
 woman with large breasts walks in the door ohh knockers will help us figure it out she walks by and he checks her out
all right straight and not subtle the man gets up and leaves
ohh he left his cell phone
oh well we can hand it to gunther and he put it in lost and found
or we could use it to call china see how those guys are doing
what if um if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and answer and we start talking and we fell in love mean would that be great story kind of like fairy tale for the digital age
yeah that does sound great going to get the phone they both get up
what wait why why do you get the story
 do know have been out on date in so long
phoebe you had date three days ago
that wasn date that was that was just friends getting together quietly having sex
okay okay see get the phone
no way no way you just broke with tag week ago
yeah breaking up and until now didn think love again
nice try
oh hey hey wait how do we fairly decide who gets the phone
 don know
well umm maybe we could uhh grabs the phone ah ha too slow
ah ha too cocky
 going to keep dating him mother and there nothing you can do about it
oh yes there is
what are you going to do kill him like you did with charles
gasps that was an accident and so were you
well at least not murderer jessica slaps her
crying oh my baby hugs dina but moves dina head to her other shoulder so that she the only one in the picture

that was great scene and and and that slap looks so real how do you do that
oh just years of experience
crying can get some ice here
oh anyway just wanted to say how wonderful think you are
youre not the fan who dying are you
say what
 supposed to meet and hug fan whose dying but that not supposed to be until to no one in particular later
no no joey tribbiani we did scene together yesterday the guy in the coma
oh that was real person
an an anyway just wanted to say that since getting your brain when you leave the show was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
 leaving the show
quickly don know why did you hear something
who told you that
oh uh one of the writers
which one was it bald or was it tall

know what it doesn matter because it is not true

and if it were true how dare you come to me ask me for tips about character that ve been playing for 20 yearsll give you tip she throws her drink in his face
ms monroe she slaps him oh there you go she storms off leaving joey standing next to dina they share nod at the ferocity of the slap they just received
no phoebe you can not get the phone that way that not fair okay look have an idea why don we why don we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him and then whoever does gets the phone
or we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone
 don think so
handing rachel the phone fine all right but bet you be singing another tune if we were fighting over ratchet
checking the speed dial all right first name on the speed dial is mom
ohh lost my mom to suicide
okay no way you can not use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin
did use that already today sorry
yes okay checking the speed dial again well now see this isn telling us anything reading the speed dial joe carlos peter ooh peter luger hat steak house
okay meat eater fine that one for you
looking at the speed dial oh win he got barney on his speed dial
so you don know that barney the store that can be know his friend house or bar who has barney the store on their speed dial
showing phoebe her phone his new girlfriend
what is that
 think it the dying cat parade
it sounds like it coming from across the street
turning around and looking oh my god

know that thing that ross was do at our wedding he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said youre half scottish right


no there is no way it can not be ross she looks through the window and sees ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes unbelievable why is your family scottish

he can not play at our wedding mean everyone will leave mean come on that is just noise it not even song
if you listen very carefully think its celebration by cool and the gang
hi pheebs

umm pheebs remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that was going to keep the uh the cute guy cell phone

and remember how said was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang could just pick it up

and do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone
ooh now you lost me
you stole the phone

umm okay but while you dial let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag rachel dials her phone and phoebe bag starts to ring oh it does work rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of phoebe handbag

that is different phone
oh is it she answers the cute guy phone uhh hello on her phone yes hi is rachel there on the other phone yes she is just one moment please to phoebe holding out both phones it for me
that is damning evidence
oh my god bet that him my digital fairy tale is about to begin wonder how should be should be uh in sexy voice hello or should be happily hi it rach phoebe knocks the phone out of rachel hand catches it and answers it would you stop doing that

oh and how will you know what time to come over
you just said it
oh okay well was kinda hoping that would just be alone know to think about my mom and her suicide
oh phoebe
what that the first time today
ohh exits
so you like the nachos uh myself partial to
interrupting 16
see you in 2003 she walks away
walking up youre absolutely right they are writing me out of the show they don know exactly when it going to happen but apparently going to be very soon and that it
 so sorry look if it was up to me you would never leave the show
yeah thanks
no mean it can believe they would do this to you and to your fans mean they are going to be devastated heart broken they love you so much
oh youre right thank you what your name again

joey well thank you that is so sweet oh excuse me she throws her drink on passing writer
it wasn my decision
to him having conversation here to joey you were saying
uh yeah ye ye ye ye ye look the the the only reason that that came up to you before was because well really nervous about about being you know if you can help me capture the essence of the character know help me keep jessica alive please
all right joey will help you not because owe it to this stupid show but because owe it to jessica
oh that great oh thank you so much
youre so welcome
hey now ve been watching some tapes how this in british accent jessica lockhart will never step foot in this place again ever
is that supposed to be me

yeah but jessica doesn have an english accent
shocked can do an english accent that baby going on my resume
well feel like snack
do you want some shortbread eh that scottish like you are
oh no thanks don like any thing from my scottish heritage

well it just my entire family was run out of scotland by vikings anyway lots of bad memories makes few unintelligible noises
oh well it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh rediscover its scottish roots
no no no theyre not theyre still very angry but know chandler is also half swedish you know what the swedish people are famous for sitting down and being quiet
well yeah yeah the scottish history is so much more
interrupting you can not play bagpipes at the wedding
how did you know about that
we heard you play all the way from your apartment
were you the ones called the cops
that not really important right now what is important is while we appreciate the gesture we just don feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding
why not
because we hate them
come on that not fair mean you haven even heard me play
we have heard you play
no youve heard my practice okay just just give me chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want and not going to tell you what song play either but uh let just say when it over ll bet there will be we bit celebration
so the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence so when jessica enters room for instance she owns everything and every person in that room joey is nodding you try
okay he scurries out the set door and re enters extremely impressed all right
no he already knows that he owns everything in the room he not finding it out for the first time so try it again
okay okay he goes out and comes back in glaring at everything
right he not angry at the room either try it again he owns it he owns the room it is his he owns owns owns owns the room he owns it joey gets snooty look on his face all right it little weird but it getting better joey is pleased oh well miss this woman so much don know what going to do mean it been 20 years of my life
oh wellhey hey maybe maybe uh maybe this is good thing know itll itll give you chance to shake things up play different characters youre so talented
 am am but don know you know an actor of certain age is not that easy
hey that not true look at uh look at angela lansbangelina jolie
 probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in but know just got so comfy here and ohh turned down some amazing work
like like what
well let just say if left 15 years ago the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today
impressed wow
but well now now different time for me starts to cry
oh hey come on don don don do this umm look let let me tell you something okay now when watch you do scene thinking boy she she is great actress she not buying it uh but but am also thinking she is hot
intrigued you think hot
you own the room she smiles and stares longingly into his eyes we should probably get get uh
oh yeah yeah we should get the pause so when jessica kisses man she usually puts umm both her hands on the man face she does so
yeah yeah noticed that is that cause she so passionate
no it because that way the camera only sees her she takes her hands off his face do you wanna try it
yeah okay he puts his hands on her face and they kiss
that was good that was really good but think your hands maybe little off they should be maybe right like she grabs the back of his neck and kisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch
hey hey
whoa why do you get to answer the door
well why shouldn
because it my apartment
well then get to give him the cell phone
okay all right hands her the phone good luck explaining all the calls to china

well the director thinks youre really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow
wow sure that great
oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity
yeah yeah sure just long as it handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold
terrific well uh there one more thing uhh uh it really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic yeah and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how she never seen naked man who wasn jewish so laughs
so what
so uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically anatomically not jewish do you know what saying


no what
an italian catholic immigrant at this time would not be

so to get this part you can be

but you are

but you told them you weren
that right
wow wow and it definitely all gone there nothing there to work with joey glares at her what were you thinking
 don know really want this part and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes like if if they want you to ride horse you tell em you can and just figure out how to do it later

just washing the windshield she turns on the wipers forcing ross off of the hood
there is no way am letting you drive this car so why don you just hand over the keys

she puts the key into the ignition which is on the left side of the steering wheel does anyone know why that is it tradition left over from porsche racing history the world greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday in the 60s lemans had unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track at the start of the race the drivers would run across the track get in the car buckle up start the car and drive off porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat belts put the car in gear and start it the driver left hand did nothing porsche in order to save few seconds in 24 hour race moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat belts with his right hand that why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel
no ah ah ah do not start this car she starts the car okay okay will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now he looks for the twenty rachel stole and doesn find it
look ross if youre so freaked out just get in the car

conan brien transcribed by eric aasen
this is special out takes episode the cast and conan are sitting around the set of central perk talking about the stuff weve never seen
this is stuff we never saw from all of the seasons so for all of the scene settings will be using the current arrangements even though some of the out takes take place when chandler was living with joey and rachel was living with monica when joey and chandler were living in monica and rachel and the current arrangements
it tradition here on friends after every taping for me to hang out with you guys they all laugh talk down the episode umm the point of this whole thing is what people see in america is they see friends they love the show it looks like smooth running machine but behind the scenes there deceit mistrust and hate and thought thought we actually take look at uh know some of these moments where you guys arethere are mistakes you make mistakes
once and while
from time to time
for example don have to memorize lines you guys actually have to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time yes
our energy just comes way up when there an audience here and when that happens something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it just doesn it just doesn work
uh oh oh umm no you didn did
oh uh uh no no no no uh uh he starts laughing causing everyone else to laugh
so we realize thatoh no she resets herself telling it telling it she loses it
ha ha lookcome on don know what to do or say he laughs
ha ha very funny don know what to do know holy crud
ha ha ha very funny look don know what to do long pause as everyone cracks up
it is one of those days
xcusa seniora voulez bere quakaybeepuck it
wow pheebs you you speak gutter
you still get nervous everybody just before show


it amazing like all week long weve weve been saying the same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up and if you mess up once then youll get nervous because youllyou know youll probably mess up again

holding her hand in front of her face when you were little you slept through through the grand canyon
watch again that hand
thisll be five ten takes

okay you know it happen
once again and action
the hand still there when when you were little you slept through the grand canyon she actually itches her nose this time
oh okay try it without the coffee cup cause think it the left hand that messing me up
when you were little you slept through the grandpointing againoh fffff
sorry let go back cause youve got more to say
do absolutely absolutely yeah that your fault say
 love you
 love you they hug
but there must be there mustare lot of moments over the years where youre just trying to do your job something goes wrong
hey and this is little extra something for know always being there for me
hey joey the camera hit our wall

ahh shbeepit that hurt
are you okay
hey rach she breaks up and goes back into monica
oh yeah then how come keephe notices that the marker board they use has been left on the entertainment center and holds up his discovery
it was so wild we told em we were the gunderson in 16
laughing spit on her
to lisa operation you had fun one
oh yeah
with operation
it was little game yeah with an electric buzzer
oh ooh and brought operation but umm lost the umm it starts buzzing it making noise
but le blanc really doesn mess up much
you don verbally mess up but sometimes physically you mess up
 have had some clumsy moments guess you can call em
he fell down once and we re did it and we went back and helaughshe was afraid he was fall down
you could actually see him trying not to fall down
pheebs he looks down as he goes down the step to make sure he didn fall again check it out he starts laughing when he realized what he did
this particular time when he continued to fall or know try not to fall was in the room with matthew and matthew was like should do it
pheebs check it out check it out check it out check it out hands her one
ooh soap opera digest
matthew you have reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes you like to you like to fool around bit mean like if something naturally going wrong you like to get in there and juice it little bit true or false
 don necessarily like to juice things
he said true or false
oh ooh ooh
what are you doing
youre still tiny bit on fire there
oh geez okay thanks
it was great seeing you the other night
well it was good to see you too did you come down here to tell me that
noo came down here to tell you something else came here to tell you still love you
what the fubeepck are you doing
now you guys work with animals lot you had to work early on with monkey
that damn monkey
that damn monkey
okay okay see now the one with the feather boa that dr francis she used to be man oh look theremarcel katie jumps awayokay and runs behind her on the back of the couch for little while
katie geez see katie come herekatie katie spills some popcorn katie come here katie she obeys and sits where she supposed to very good
lisa laugh though thereit so infectious it one of those things just forget about it once it starts it all gone
no know don want to switch come on can throw wet paper towels here
well at monica you can eatsuddenly cracks up
okay shh yeah cause it not silly
here we go

and action
no no ph ph ph ph she starts laughing
to lisa ready

and then it just builds on itself and there no doing the scene after mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it
for me have hard time with le blanc in particular when when mean when
to matt you bastard
yeah what did do
 keep straight face he he delivers like this look reaction to you or certain take mean find it so funny


 mean what kind of an actor what kind of an actor can even say hmm noodle soup
that good one they both laugh
now we should go back and take the other line
okay ll just put little more booze on there pours some more on
 think subconsciously
cracking up nope you lost me
no come on
okay the next situation is for rachel the wedding is about to start you walk into the back room and you find monica taking nap with ross ross lies on the floor ll be monica go he jumps down and cuddles up with ross
jumping up no no no
well be right back with more friends less me
 doing my brother
that gross
you uh youve worked withthey always say performer should never work with pets or children
aww the kids

okay nowwhat is my first line
prompting her what did we agree

the good thing about the young kids though theyre completely unpredictable which is lot of fun as an actor to respond with but there was one story
oh little ben
where the story was that was anticipating that would be around to hear my son first words spoken but the scene was about that he wasn supposed to be able to speak and uh for some reason when we started doing the show
hi were visiting

it ben and his da da da da can you say da da know you might as well say it because told your
da da
can you say da da see tell your mommies you said it anyway so you might as well try
da da

da da
yeah he saying da da
and then sometimes during the show know but youre like the scene going one way but youre just tempted to say something another time like do you remember that one where monica baking cookies in our old apartment
she trying to intrigue us to hang out with her
yeah she trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to come hang out in her new place and were sitting there eating pizza and think it was you points to lisa that said
what do smell
 think was supposed to say don know and go over and open the door and went
what do smell
pause sorry raises his hand in shame
everyone laughs and then it was like four takes later before we could get through it with straight face
what do smell
le blanc
what do smell
 don know but it smells good he gets up and heads for the door only to stop short and start laughing
but audiencesyou have live studio audience and they must love that they must love it when they see you guys playing
what are you guys doing


so that you will intentionally do something thattheyll theyll intentionally screw it up


noticing the laughter why what the matter
to courtney you youve worn fat suit on the show and lot of people love you in the fat suit do you like wearing the fat suit is it fun
 melting
they made me dance in the fat suit
 heard some of you guys talking about this earlier but sometimes there just word that someone has to say that youll get hung up on and itll justthe way you say the word is funny to everybody else
that tastes like feet
it tastes like mimicking him in high pitched voice feet
okay were good

that tastes like feet
sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and youllwell be rehearsing during the week and you justwhatever whatever the joke is it so funny we can get through it in rehearsal and just
you just know
you you mentally make flag on it and you say okay show night justll never be able to get through this
are you saying that you don want to get with this
you see don saystarts laughing
spitting the cookie out onto napkin oh sweet jebeepsus oh monica these are the laughing cookies they serve in hell
noticing the woman on the screen whoa she purty
oh yeah and she really nice too she taught me about know how to work with the cameras and smell the fart acting

 sorry
excuse me what
when you have to do physical business for scene mean there must be there must be lot of funny moments when you have to physically do task as part of scene

can ask you something
uh huh
when carol was pregnant with ben

were you this irritating

excuse me
oh nothing nothing just uh youve been little short with me lately not trying to irritate you
well then you just must have natural talent for it
know what the doctor will be in soon why don we not speak until then
silently okay pause seriously breathe louder ross that great
know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver baby that half human and half pure evil
hi dr long how are you
to rachel oh youre nice to her
she has the drugs
well do quick check
okay rachel lies back
so eight days late huh

you must be little uncomfortable
eh just tad
youre about 80 percent effaced so youre on your way it still could last little while longer if youre anxious there are few ways to help things along
do them
actually theyre things you can do just some home remedies but in my experience ve found that some of them are quite effective
well we are ready to try anything
okay there an herbal tea you can drink

you can take some caster oil there eating spicy foods
great we will do all of those
taking long walk and then there the one that proved most effective sex
youve got to be kidding me
good job joe well done top notch
you liked it you really liked it
oh ho ho yeah
which part exactly
the whole thing can we go
oh no no no give me some specifics
 love the specifics the specifics were the best part

you fell asleep there was no kangaroo they didn take any of my suggestions that for coming buddy ll see you later starts to walk out
don go sorry so sorry sees another guy who is still asleep look this guy fell asleep he fell asleep too be mad at him looks at him more closely or call an ambulance



what did the doctor say any news on when the baby will come
no but she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor
yeah we tried them all we went for walk uh we tried special tea caster oil spicy food nothing has worked
well there is one thing that we haven tried but someone thinks that mimicking ross that will open up can of worms
well what is it what is it if it help bring the baby here like today mean think you should do it
it sex
do it

 just saying it been really long time for you mean women have needs do it get yours
oh don know about that no think that if the two of you had sex the the the repercussions would be catastrophic
all right let be practical if ross isn willing to do it he not the only guy in the world you can have sex with you can borrow chandlerchandler is good
monica what is the matter with you
nothing just want the baby to be born today
why why today
okay fine keep betting phoebe that youre have the baby and don want to lose again

mike now enters and stands behind phoebe oh no no no no no no do get me wrong no he not in like sissy way no no no when he gets going he can rattle headboard like sailor on leave
that my boy bitsy walks away

 not watch it do need to watch it mean what good could possibly come from watching sighs well we know watch it chandler moves to put the tape in the vcr and joey enters the apartment
hey dude what up
do judge me only human
did you take that tape
 had to okay imagine you were married and you found tape of your wife in another guys apartment would you need to know what was on it
 do know who married to
some girl
she hot

how did she get me to settle down
allright watch it mean look it probably not even what think it is and even if it is it ca possibly be as bad as what picturing in my head laughs nervously can it
guess do know my experience if girl says yes to being taped she does say no to much else tell ya
then you re have to watch it for me
backs off what whoo what
just for few seconds so can know what it is please
all right fine but if enjoy this you have only yourself to blame chandler turns his back to the tv joey puts the tape in the vcr switches it on and watches what on the tape it clearly american football match with the referee whistle blowing the crowds cheering
why am hearing cheering
well it okay its like its just football game
football just football
yeah see you were all worried for nothing
it football it just football this is great this is the first time ve ever enjoyed football it may be customary to get beer chandler walks to the fridge his back turned to the tv and moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd joey eyes double in size what the chandler turns around but joey already took sprint for chandler jumps and floors chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door what are you doing
you do wanna see what just saw at this moment monica comes home and sees chandler flat on his back on the floor and joey pinning him down
what are you guys doing monica hears the moaning coming from the tv and looks at it oh my god is that richard it only takes split second for joey to realise he pulls monica down by her jacket and she falls face down next to chandler chandler gets up bit and joey quickly covers chandler eyes with his hand
okay aahhh please laugh for mommy please please laugh for mommy rachel makes funny face sticking her tongue out making farting noise and using her hands as antlers wiggling her fingers no response from emma not funny huh oh so is it only offensive novelty rap or maybe just you know rap in general cause mommy can rap rachel tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process my name is mommy and here to say that all the babies are oh ca rap allright sweetheart this is only because love you so much and know that you re not tell anybody rachel face is telling oh what am doing the things have to go through and she starts to rap like big butts and can not lie you other brothers ca deny when girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and round thing in your face emma starts to laugh yes yes yes yes oohhhhh oh rachel now really gets into it and her insecure movements start getting better like big butts and can not lie you other brothers ca deny oh emma you re laughing oh you are you really do like big butts do you oh you beautiful little weirdo rachel picks up emma and ross now enters

oh you missed it she was laughing oh it was amazing it was amazing it was the most beautiful beautiful sound that
oh know is it ooh what you do to get her to laugh
oh you know just couple of things tried just sang little doo itsy bitsy spider
you sang baby got back did you
nothing else worked that girl is all about the ass
and then it goes back to the chorus smelly cat sme lly ca not your fau lt and that the end of the song realise that you did ask to hear it but uhm no one had spoken in seventeen minutes
phoebe writes lots of great songs wha what was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved
oh pervert parade
sighs no
oh ode to pubic hair
stop the butler serves dinner
oh god is that veal
mom thought told you phoebe vegetarian

oh no no no no that okay that okay mean am vegetarian except for veal yeah no veal love
phoebe you do have to eat
no no no actually it any baby animals kittens fish babies you know especially veal and this this nice vein of fat running through it she cuts the meat picks it up with her fork and holds it in front of her mouth which she keeps closed trying to overcome her vegetarian thoughts and puts it in her mouth clearly not enjoying the meat hmmm yummy everybody seems okay with it except mike he making hmmmm face then phoebe swallows it hmmm at first she likes it but then in an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table you hear door slamming
so what do you think looks at his parents which look in disgust
so you stole that tape from richard apartment
whoho ho listen to the judgement from the porn star
that tape was never meant to be seen by pauses joey would feel more comfortable if was having this conversation in private
laughs monica look do think you and have any secrets anymore monica keeps looking at joey not ready to joke about it yet okay see you later joey walks out
why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it
because that who am okay sure mature man like richard could see tape like that and it would bother him just be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men club over brandy and moustaches
is all this about you not being able to grow moustache
this is about you and richard he clearly not over you he keeps tape so he can look at it whenever he wants
is that sad mean can you see how pathetic that is you should be jealous you should feel bad for him
oh yeah well poor richard can grow moustache
chandler this is not our problem we ve got each other that all that matters
yeah oh but just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air
cowboy boots ve never worn cowboy boots in my whole life she turns on the video again
oh good good play more cause wanna see how it ends
that not me
what that not you life is good again ride cowgirl
that bastard taped over me chandler expression changes
is that problem
 it just so insulting big spring for new blank tape doctor
 ca imagine what he sees in her
she actually makes me miss that pill popping ex wife of his mike walks in oh hello dear
hey what going on
we were just chit chatting how your friend
 little better
by the way do you know who moving back into town tom and sue daughter jen
you remember her michael she lovely and well behaved and single
 not interested
oh please darling let be honest you can have all the sailor fun you want with that one but let be real
all right stop you know all phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her and maybe that has been clear all the time but she did her best and yeah she little different than you are
michael pimp spit in her mouth phoebe almost enters the room but she hears the discussion and waits and evesdrops next to the door opening
so what mean if even can get past that it should bother you and you do have to like her you just have to accept the fact that do mean if you even ca be civil to the woman love
the woman you what phoebe overheard what michael said and now enters the room
yeah the woman you what
the woman love he walks to phoebe love you which is probably something should say for the first time in front of my parents and tom and sue who are by the way the most sinfully boring ve ever met in my life
 love you too

okay it time for dinner everyone we re using our fancy china um and its very expensive so please be careful
woah woah nearly really drops the plate and more seriously woah
okay just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved pinches ross arm
ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt
hey how come my plate less fancy then everyone else do you not trust me with fancy plate
no honey its that special plate see its game whoever gets that plate wins
 ca believe won
its such slap in the face your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me
monica is ross sister
no ross sister was really fat
that was me
no she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow rachel around like puppy dog
hey amy you ve got to stop doing that
 amy gets pissed and starts cutting food on the fancy plate very harshly you can hear the silveware scraping the fancy plate
okay listen know you re having little bit of family crisis but you do have to take it out on the plates mean mean in fact think that everyone should cut their food like this
 monica holds turkey leg up in the air over the plate trying to cut meat off with knife
now see this way you protect the plate and lets face it you have fun
okay how about this you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies then do get the baby
no if crazy plate lad sees monica frustrated at this comment if monica dies then would get emma right
 ross and rachel pause and ponder this
well actually
actually what
well its just its just in that case then um emma would go to my parents

hurts does it
 chandler gives look that says yeah
uh who has to die for me to get her
 everyone is looking around and at joey with looks of what on their faces
so if monica not around then not good enough to raise emma
no that that is not what we re saying
yeah he lying he looked down
 joey looks to phoebe and she nods in agreement
well what is wrong with me am am incomptent because managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you
honey you re taking this the wrong way we think you re going to be wonderful parent it just you re more the fun parent
yeah and we want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh uh discliplinarin someone who can be firm and strict
that not how you see me is it
no you re all about the fun
look may not know lot about babies but do you really think not capable
no you both are equally capable its just you re strongest when when you re together
ok so if we both had emma and die knocks on table she have to give her up
sure monica would have to give her up
 lie better then that right
so let me get this straight so my two friends die get emma then my wife dies then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me
there your movie claps
monica opens her front door chandler is sitting in the hallway
hey there you are you disappeared after dinner
oh did somebody miss me is there child to raise poorly
ross and rachel do know what they re talking about mean its not like their so responsible emma is product of bottle of merlot and five year old condom

was it really that bad
at one point near the end she deliberately defecated

ok well this is like that in no way had had dream last night that wanted to kiss joey
wow do you mean like kiss him kiss him
oh yeah mean that was pretty intense
what do you think brought than on
 do know mean maybe that something to do with the fact that saw him do love scene yesterday
 love scene with who

olivia thought she was marrying connor pause oh right real life more important
so do you think that my dream means anything
 do know mean you saw him do love scene so maybe you do have thing for joey maybe you have thing for drake
ah well it was joey reading drake lines in the dream
of course it was trust me when it comes to psychology know what talking about took two psych classes in college
you took the same class twice
it was hard


here monica look what got to wear when play at the restaurant she dons top hat uh huh wait she raises pair of spectacles to her eyes right mean this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man
oh phoebe maybe was clear before really love listening to your music here but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place
right yeah ok ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault
phoebe it not what you wear it sort of your songs just do think you should play at the restaurant anymore
oh ok fine just take the hat back she puts the hat in bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot
hey so you guys the funniest thing happened at work
my songs are good enough for your restaurant
ok we re still on that
 did say your songs were not good enough
then what wrong with them would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food
tiny portions
yeah well excuse me ordered the smoked salmon appetizer but peering through her spectacles ca see it ca see it
phoebe it not about quantity
well it not about quality
oh really you want to talk about quality have you heard of key it what some people sing in
well at least all my songs do taste like garlic yeah there are other ingredients monica
ok so that what we re doing you know when in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs wearing ear plugs
ear plugs or cloves of garlic
you know what take back what said before you keep playing at the restaurant because with your music driving people inside my bar sales are going up like crazy
what are people having the garlic martini
here your copy of the bill we hope you enjoyed your stay
oh we did and you still have all your lamps
oh did factor in the room tax
oh dude do worry about it found an unattended maid car we re way ahead of the game

why the only person my playing is bothering is you
oh yeah ok let settle this come on
while monica drags her in the restaurant get your garlic peelers off me
to the restuarant customers excuse me excuse me hi monica geller the head chef here pauses as if waiting for something ok was actually expecting little applause there but whatever ok quick question by show of hands how many of you were bothered by this woman singing outside few people raise their hands
ok ok how many of you enjoyed the music outside few people raise their hands ha
alright let me ask you this question how many of you thought the music was fine but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant few raise their hands again
ok well who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky
ok who thinks the food is delicious and little pretention never hurt anyone few raise their hands
ok well alright who thinks the food is fine the music was fine but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking all raise their hands
excuse us then to phoebe alright here question who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now raises her hand
oh who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great raises her hand
 sorry
 sorry too they hug
ooohh hey wanna stick around and whip you up some dinner
yeah as long as it free food here is ridiculously over
smiling raising her hand who hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you wo hate me

well hey you know what else could use there scene where drake sneaks into olivia bedroom and she does know he there which never happened with us and he knows he should be there but he just wants to look at her you know in romantic voice and remember all those mornings before you even put on your make up when would think to myself my god she is beautiful rachel looks very moved and it hurts so much cuz knew could never tell you pauses while looking at her with sentiment but it was worth it just to be there looking at you

wow ikea what rich culture uhm you know what have friend who is masseuse
oh ja ja
yah she uhm not very good though phoebe looks devastated

slowly yeah but you know what think you should give joey chance mean he great guy and sure he does know that much about art but you know you can always talk about that with someone else

oh ca believe my sperm have low motility because let me tell you when was growing up they sure seem to be in hurry to get places
entering hi there


 sorry there was better news from your test last week but wanted to talk to you about your options

above all even though your chances of conceiving through natural means are great you never know so keep having sex on regular basis
oh damn it
do worry after while he tune it out
ok given your situation the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy or insemination using sperm donor
long pause ok
and of course if you feel that neither of those is right for you you can always adopt
is that hint because we love you doctor connelly but we do think we want you to be our child dr connelly glares at him wow talking about an inhospitable environment
hi ok you re ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping
oh yeah let do it
to charlie alright have good time they kiss
not find any clothes in there
entering hey you guys

guess who up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference
umh kurts baley
yeah right what was last time he met submission deadline for an abstract he and charlie laugh then joey starts laughing too without any reason well why are you laughing
just seeing what it be like to be paleontologist it fun yeah

oh you re not do magic trick are ya
tsz no he goes to sit down dropping multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve
entering hey guys
wait minute you guys oh wanna ask you something may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if do love for you guys to come and hear me

bye see ya she goes
sitting down on the couch ok
all right so how did it go at the fertility clinic
not as much fun as last time apparently you only get porn if you re giving sperm sample
so so what did the doctor say
well there surrogacy but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying child she has felt that watching surrogate would be too hard for her
so you re ruling out surrogacy

so do have to learn what that means
aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination so we re talking about sperm donors
enough said there for you man where is she upstairs
stopping joey ah ha
how do you feel about all this
 wish there was an easier way for us to have child but do think there is one
come on ross be good guy step up and do it
puzzled what
looking astonished what no am not going to give them ben
the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are are staggering
mmm mm
reading from notepad mean we ve been accepting leakey dates as given but if they re off by even hundred thousand years or so then you can you can just throw most of our assumptions you know right in the trash he throws the notepad in the waste bin so so what am saying is is is that he picks the notepad back from the waste bin is that the repercussions could be huge mean not just in palaeontology but if if you think about it in evolutionary biology uh genetics geology uh mean truly the mind boggles
oh that not what you want
to girl incentive for men
oh take some of that
pheebs that for men
no know this way when go to the party later mike will know am over him cause smell like another guy to the shop assistant yeah

ladies ross speech is in 45 minutes

damn it
from across the wall walls are pretty thin guys
then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating
look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan so leathery and wrinkled so jealous
finally factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered gigantosaurus argentinasaurus
to paleontologist sitting next to him not to mention the cold sores
and that just the herbivores not even discuss the carnivores their heads are already too big which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development
to the one sitting next to him really
but all kidding aside in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be separate species from homo erectus

he said erectus
you re you re kidding right
no he really said it
and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus


concluding his speech in very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century pauses thank you
oh thanks guys
shaking hands with ross thought it was wonderful

jarvis oberblau cornell sighs mean the ideas you put forth and and from someone so young and sighs again and smiles at ross blissfully
with frozen smile on his face realizing something wrong with jarvis ok now now we re just holding hands pulls his hand away

well this is going well chandler looks worried
comes out holding the tape here how know you did watch the tape ok puts it into the vcr if you had seen what was on this tape believe me you would have some comments alright now remember got paid lot of money for this and it only aired in japan presses play and he appears on the tv screen and tv commercial begins
joey says ichiban it displays few girls dancing around and joey fills most of the screen he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them saying lipstick for men it goes on to show him playing guitar and putting on more blue lipstick in the end he says seductively ichiban lipstick for men and sahiko and it ends chandler and rachel are speechless
yelling at chandler and that how know you did watch the tape goes back to his room and slams the door
he really is chameleon
smiling from ear to ear well gladys say hello to your new home she holds out the painting

genuinely excited about it yeah yeah and you can get rid of that french poster

alright fine you can keep it as long as you do mind that she haunted
hey what what wey whoo what what
well legend has it joey that she comes alive when you re asleep
she climbs out of the frame and then drags her half body across the floor just looking for legs to steal in spooky slow voice and then with her one good hand she slo owly re aches up and turns your doorknob

oh my god

now what do you say
lying is wrong
and and
 pretty little girl
 knew it
your ex boyfriend is insane
did you get the grant
no did and you want to know why because your ex boyfriend is still in love with you

yeah he would give me the grant because would give you up
benji is in love with me mean he broke up with me and besides he very ethical man
really is it ethical to ask someone in grant review who was the voice of underdog
 sure he was just joking ross
if you do believe me let go talk to him okay telling you he did ask me one paleontological question

oh sorry no he did ask me one uhm how do you spell mboscodictiosaur
well if it like the lake mbosco in congo then

dr geller charlie what are you what are you doing here
 want you to tell her everything about the deal you tried to make with me about the crazy questions you wally cox that the voice of underdog
like tried to tell you in the interview ross this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia
no no no do do that want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth

alright it true behaved horribly but it only because still love you and would do anything to have you back in my life
too little too late benji
 ca believe this
 never should have broken up with you think about you all the time mean do you ever still think about me
indignant no


 do know what to say benji this is all so romantic

listen know may be way out of bounds here but is there any chance you will take me back

sweetie this conversation is starting to make me little uncomfortable
oh god am so sorry but she puts her hand on ross cheek mean it there so much history between us you know
puts his hand on ross other cheek sorry too
 love you
 love you too and they start to kiss
okay that it we are seeing other people

that funny we were doing the same thing

it really crazy the hall the dress the food had no idea how expensive this stuff was
yeah it is really pricey mean freaked when first heard the numbers
so what did you two do about it
it was pretty simple actually came up with couple of cost cutting solutions wrote out list and monica told me to go to hell
there no way around it pheebs you just have to accept the fact that this is cost you lot of money
 heard that weddings are like 40 billion dollar year industry
yeah and responsible for just like half of that
but really it does seem like this money could be put to better use
are you serious
yeah now how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall
 think it would make me wanna marry you even more he kisses her
 ve got to say you guys that an incredible gesture
to ross maybe you do that next time you get married
no no no the next time it be hawaii at sunset pause but maybe the time after that

sarcastically we
you know you do want me to help you ca have it both ways
hey is this person who decides whether or not you get baby
kind of she coming by to interview us and see where we live
and it has to go perfectly because if she does like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state

pointing at himself celebrity
ok so think just about done here unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere like porn or cigarettes

oh yeah joey does share food mean just last week we were having breakfast and he had couple of grapes on his plate and
to joey you would let her have grape
oh no not me emma
mad and pointing finger to himself joey doesn share food
well still think that it stupid reason not to call someone again you are calling her and if you need to just get an extra plate of fries for the table
he thinks little considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied like that sharing buffer yeah ll order some extra fries maybe plate of onion rings yeah and shrimp cocktail and some buffalo wings maybe an individual pizza uh and some mozzarella sticks he looks absorbed in his food thoughts what were we talking about
you know we should just go not find anything here this stuff is ridiculous
ah this place is great

rach come on not wear any of this he picks up shirt nothing silver rachel sighs ok nothing with hair rachel sighs again and nothing with padlocks on it rachel heaves long disappointing sigh
ross look know that some of this stuff is out there but mean come on look at this look at this sweater she picks up blue sweater mean this is just beautiful
feeling the fabric wow this is really soft he looks the price three hundred and fifty dollars
yeah down from seven hundred you are saving like two hundred bucks
both logic and math are taking serious hit today

so you re saying uh if wear these pants might be getting into hers
to phoebe why do men keep talking to me like this
the adoption agency in ohio monica and chandler are still talking with erica
so the fact that am doctor and my wife reverend that important to you
yeah read some great applications but then thought who better then minister to raise child

plus thought the baby would be in good hands with doctor
uh good hands she holds chandler hands healing hands
reverend can ask does the bible say anything about adoption
it says do it and behold she did adopt onto them baby and it was good

yeah wow
 was wondering you both have such serious jobs to monica would you have time to take care of baby and your flock
oh you know my flock is good mean yeah my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point good flock flock flock flock
to chandler being doctor must take up lot of time
no ot for me it does
so how everything going in here
we re great think may have asked all my questions
do you have any question for erica
yeah actually so you read file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us
yes our system assures total anonimity we re very proud of it
you should be you re really on top of stuff
to erica well then if there nothing else then the two of us should talk
actually do think we have to
we do
yeah when read about you two was pretty sure wanted you but just thought we should meet face to face to the agency guy ve made my decision choose them
oh my god this is great this is so great to chandler who looks bewildered did you hear that
yeah did
to erica hey thank you thank you so much they hugs you are so going to heaven
joey apartment rachel and phoebe walk in loaded with bags

oh okay wait are we in joey imagination
looking into one of her shopping bags oh no took one of ross bags by mistake and one of mine is missing
oh well ross probably has it you can get it from him later
ross walks into central perk wearing pink and white ladies shirt joey is on the couch
to joey so what do you think shows himself joey observes him with strange look on his face
 think were not wearing the same shirt anymore
not getting it yeah yeah rachel picked it out for me she told me to trust her and you know what glad did turned quite few heads on my way over here
now laughing little dude really do think you should be wearing that
oh see somebody is afraid of little competition with the ladies
looking little agitated now looks like someone is the ladies
you re just jealous because you could pull this off yeah now if you excuse me getting up and taking his coat have date as he is walking out everyone turns and stares at him see to joey all eyes on me
we are not signing those papers

she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica
well if you think about it am kind of like reverend mean as chef serve god by feeing the hungry and poor looks very convinced about what she just said
your veal chop is 3495
 on chandler think we have been given an opportunity mean the mistake has already been made they are writing up the paper right now
but we are not the one she chose how can you feel okay about this
very emotional because we may not be who she thinks we are but no one will ever love that baby more than us

 mean who knows how long it take for someone else to give us baby what if what if no one ever picks us
oh honey
almost crying please please we are so close
monica want baby too but this woman is giving away her child she deserves to know who it going to monica realizes chandler is right she almost crying okay right they hug

well there is chance it another guy mean have only ever been with two guys but they sorta overlapped
so what does the other guy do does he go to college too
no he in prison more shocked looks from monica and chandler
was he falsely accused of something they look hopeful
no he killed his father with shovel monica and chandler jaws drop but other than that he great guy
 bet his dad does think so
are you awake
of course awake assume from now on that always awake he turns the light on
alright we do know that it him mean it could be the football guy
honey it us of course it the shovel killer
alright lets say that it is him would we not want the baby no would we treat him any differently
 keep an eye on him we have to find out which one the father is

 dunno are there tests for these things right
yeah but maybe we re just over reacting
pff easy for you to say he father killer he probably loves him mommy he probably got tattoo that says mom on his shovel wielding arm
we will now count from one to five un deux trois quatre cinq

in the future when girl asks for some ill advised sympathy sex just do it she smiles fakely at him
half amused wait wait looks around little you re mad at me about last night was just trying to do the right thing
sarcastically really well it seems to me if you done the right thing would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied
acknowledging the last part of her sentence well

well it makes me feel sad but
talking to ross

well rachel moving to another country not being able to see her every day how can be okay with this

do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back she would take it
how is that happen
is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes
 do know could talk to her boss yeah met him at that christmas party we really hit it off
you mean the guy who kept calling you ron
 did say we were brothers
hey phoebe hey tell me what you think all right the house next door to the one that we re buying in westchester just went on the market wanna take look at it but chandler does
we close escrow tomorrow so seeing another house can only confuse us and we re easily confused we re not very bright
but what if it is better than ours should we at least look
what do you think pheebs
well think that shirt makes you look like you should work at baskin robbins anyway hey is joey agent estelle leonard

she died
you re kidding
that terrible
yeah last saturday wow she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic chandler and monica look puzzled oh wait minute read the wrong one
oh yeah
yeah she was just an agent
joey be so upset
 know he always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic
well we can not tell joey about this he already flipping out about everything that changing this will push him over the edge
seriously you do think we should tell him
well not for little while let just give him few days to get used to everything else
what if he reads it in the paper
unless snoopy says it to charlie brown think we re okay
yeah friend of rachel green uhm actually we met at the christmas party about two years ago
oh right uhm don
close ron shakes hands
uh what can do for you
uhm well here to see if you give rachel her job back
ah did she ask you to come here and do this
oh no at first have to get you to agree then we see if she wants to come back
wow that is tempting
look she loved her job here and let face it you re not find anyone who did it as well as she did it is that true
she is good
surprised huh took shot there
but sorry there nothing can do ah it not true there is nothing want to do
 see thanks very much he gets up and walks to the door on his way out he looks at the photographs mr zelner has near his door he picks one up is this your son
yeah his name is ross ross looks very surprised what
oh nothing it just it close to ron does he does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance
yeah they re all he talks about why
how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left just the two of us and he can touch anything he wants mr zellner looks shocked just heard it as you must have heard it and that not good let me start again paleontologist you ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones fossils
you can really arrange that
you let rachel come back and it done
well guess having rachel back would be the worst thing in the world
yeah yes thank you this is great thank you so much and swear your kid is going to have the time of his life
that great worry about little ross he always reading he collecting rocks and he obsessed with dinosaurs
he ll be fine
hey phoebe
hey everything ok
 just mad at my agent
estelle why
there part in tv movie that would be perfect for and did even be put up for it she better have good reason
 guessing she does
well taking his cell phone out of pocket wanna hear it because she keeps doing this
well no no wait wait wait all right got go just listen promise me that you will wait minute before you call her
ok why
because promise between friends means never having to give reason she leaves
 love that saying

joey it estelle
 was just call you that weird
it little coincidental but believable joey nods in agreement listen sure you re wondering why did get you an audition for that tv movie
yeah actually am
 guess dropped the ball there whoopsie
that it you know it seems all you do lately is drop the ball
do take that tone with me who you think you are alan lemond the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic
no no look all saying is that you re my agent ok and you re not getting me into any auditions and tired of it
what are you saying
 saying that pause this is working for me anymore ok estelle you re fired goodbye he hangs up the phone
man tough week for estelle


emma left her stuffed rex at my house you know she ca sleep without it
oh well she asleep now stop forcing that thing on her

oh you re not believe what happened to me today ralph lauren called and gave me my job back

yee mean it was so weirdest thing they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back mean that place must have been falling apart without me
so you re not going to paris
no still going
wh wh what
when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back the offered me more money is that great
yeeeah they high five
oh sure showing it to someone else right now but please look around

it feels like we re cheating on our house and if we re cheat should it be with like hot younger house that does stuff that our house wo do
ours is so much better this living room is smaller the dining room looks like cave what hole
so what do you think
love it
well we already have one offer on it and think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one
they could be our neighbors what are they like
oh the woman upstairs is very nice she and her husband have two kids he on wall street and she
oh my god

hey joey want come with me to are you ok
yeah just just feel bad about firing estelle this is got to be killing her
no that would kill her ordinary embolism might
 do know she got to be taking it hard was like her only client except for this guy who eats paper and guessing he eats more money than he makes look know she not great agent but she did stick with me for ten years call her and hire her again
no no no do call her you wait for her to call you joey considers it

because patience is the road to understanding she thinks which is the key to happy heart
impressed you blow me away
picking up her bag all right so promise you re wait for her to call you
 promise and that means never having to give reason phoebe stops herself from laughing and leaves
and yet never run into beyonce
you two know each other
oh we go way back before monica made an honest man out of him chandler used to be my little love muffin does her irritating laugh so are you guys thinking of getting this house too ooh are we have bidding war better warn you toughie playfully punches chandler who tries to get away from her
at janice punching do do looks disgusted
no actually we re buying the house next door janice gasps
to monica and with bulging eyes why
looks confused and scared do know why
ooh that decides it then was on the fence but knowing that you two would be our neighbors ah now we have to get it chandler and monica are utterly shocked ellen we re going to talk numbers grabs ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside
this can not be happening
okay the realtor said another couple made an offer maybe the janice wo get it maybe the other couple will
the only way that that is going to happen is if the other couple are the hitlers
thinks little more okay okay clapping her hands all right what if we got both houses huh we can turn this house into guest house
that is great idea and by the way do mean to sound distasteful but when did you start crapping money
okay you come up with an idea
alright alright we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house we can still get out
but we love our house
will we love it so much with her next door and she be louder out here too just the crickets and apes janice voice oh my god
okay but if we do get this house she stil show up wherever we go mean at least if she here it eliminates the element of suprise mean never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body she shows this with her index finger mimicking it pushing something up
looks afraid but at the same time knows she right well we have to do something we ca have her living next door janice laughs loudly outside oh that does it too motions with his index finger like monica did
who is it
enters it me ron mr zellner looks annoyed look um now rachel turned you down but think there is way you might be able to get her to come back
this may surprise you but re hiring fired employees is not my main job
just hear me out how would you feel about offering her raise looks hopeful
obviously amused not good ron
perhaps can persuade you what if you can give your son this takes huge egg out of his back genuine pterodactyl egg whispers replica
takes long look at the egg while he considers it wow that pretty cool takes the egg from ross
huh so we have deal
okay you got it
yes yes
this is make me very popular
oh grins believe me the ladies they love it
looks at ross for long moment confused meant with my son
good cause the ladies not so much shakes his head give him thumbs up and leaves
oh my god still in shock when his mobile rings he picks it up hello
on the other side of the line still pretending to be estelle joey it estelle joey eyes bulge up he looks afraid

yeah wanted to call and tell you that there no hard feelings for firing me
still scared ok ay just ca believe you re calling me
well did think should just drop by
no no no starts looking around the room terrified do drop by do drop by
anyway you did what you had to do okay

looks around it alright look kiddo got go good luck with the career you re be huge
thanks for everything estelle bye hangs up and reads the phone display out of area boy say
the hitlers will be so disappointed
all right got to run tell monica say goodbye and see you later neighbor janice laugh
